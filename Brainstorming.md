# Brainstorming

## Plot
How do we first enter the halls?

How do we abnormally splice?

 - A entity is hunting us, but we almost escape.  Out of anger, it loses control and accidentally creates a break in reality, which sends us to the computer.

What happens while we are wandering the halls?

What happens when we splice?

 - We could be knocked unconscious, and wake up
 - We could fall over, lose our footing.

What danger are we first in?

How do I survive the fall?

What does Juna try to hide from me?

How do I find Arina?

How do we get to the Office?


## The Computer

How does the Computer guide us?

How does it try to kill us?

What are it's motives?

What is it's name?

What is it's history?

What is it's Purpose?

## The Office

What is it fighting?

Why is it sad?

## Deverell and Arina

What does Arina have in her bag?

 - *One* sleeping bag.
 - Some money
 - Books

Are we the first wanderers to find the Computer?

How old are we?

What are our different reactions?

How do they reflect our personality?

## Emotional Aspect

How do I make my story feel more liminal? More Lonely?

 - A computer lab, empty and unused.  Dark.  No one comes here anymore, all the computers are powered off (you cant turn them on)
 - A left behind coffee cup.
 - A carefully tended garden -- But where's the gardener?
 - A security box, or desk, unmanned.
 - Tools that were used to build this place.
