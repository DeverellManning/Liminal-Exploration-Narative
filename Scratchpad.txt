	“I was wondering about things.  Since we spliced and ended up here.  You know, there were so many things I was worrying about before. Like school, robotics, homework, church, projects, relationships.  Since we spliced, since our arrival, that all just.  Gone?  I feel like I should be sad for this loss, but…  I almost just feel relieved.  I think.  Like a weight has been taken off my shoulders.  Plus you, you’re with me, and I’m a farax.“
	“It’s not like were in paradise though.  I mean, the only reason we are still alive even is because we walk every day, and we are just lucky that we find food and water.  Well I guess water pretty easy to find now...but it wasn’t before.  I mean, shouldn’t you be worried about all of this?”
	“I am, of course.  I guess.  Maybe I have just gotten used to being here?”
	“I feel like I should be a lot more concerned, but…”
	“You know, I’m starting to get the feeling like this was supposed to happen.  And I’m fine with that!  I don’t know the future, but I’m interested, I guess.”
	“It’s your inner explorer coming out, Deverell.”  Deverell smiles at this.
