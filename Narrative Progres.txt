We are wandering in the dim light.  A low buzz of fans layered on the hum of power running through the machines that line the walls.  I and Arina had just arrived here.  I’m pretty sure it won’t be safe.  Before we spliced here we were running from something, and it was catching up.  Of course I can’t feel safe.  But here I am, with my friend Arina, and things could be so much worse.


        This odd place.  It is barely lit - Sometimes there is a dim square on the ceiling, but if not, it’s just the light emanating  from the indecipherable panels on the walls.  The wallway is lined with machines reminiscent of a supercomputer imagined in the 80s.  Large portions of the face are covered in rows of glowing buttons.  In some places there are old style bus ports, or what might be a floppy disk reader.  I don’t touch any of it, for two reasons:  First of all, just in the few hallways we’ve been through, there is so much that you could mess with, and still no information on what any of it does.  Besides that, since we first got here yesterday, none of our experiences would lead me to believe that I could do anything beneficial.
After nothing happens, I start talking.
