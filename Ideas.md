A fox is?

I am here to do something productive. I want to write a narrative “Memoir” based on my life, but
composed of fictional elements. I will use metaphor to compare pieces of my life to elements of
the story’s plot and setting. The plot line will be up and down, so it won't have a big max point,
but many little ones. I am thinking of a limited set of characters, but I could stretch myself.
#### Ways to stretch myself:
- Dialogue and conversation
- More characters
- The setting as a character
- Meta stories
## Characters:
| Deverell |
|-|
| - Represents myself.
| - In what way?
| -

| Arina
|-|
|- Represents myself.
|- In what way?

## Thoughts:
- Author’s notes scattered throughout.
- Problems:
	- What is so interesting to me about exploring liminal spaces?
	- How does it relate to my life?
	- Is this even a good idea?
	- Maybe I can move on from that a little. We/I aren't just “lost,” and not just vast spaces without people.
	- We could even drop in and out of reality during the story.
	- What if no one notices that we are different?
		- Like my actual life. Plus, it would be funny.
	- Humor would be great to add to this.
	- How do I write without getting too distracted?
	- What events in my life can help inspire this story?
- Other decisions:
	- POV
	- Tense.
		- Am I narrating what has already happened, or going through it as it
		happens?
	- Any foreshadowing?
		- Environmental foretelling, as in I don’t know of future events, but I
		might get clues from the environment.
	- Format might work well as a journal.
- In fact, a theme of the fuzzy line between reality and fiction might work great. The
author's notes could reflect a bunch of things. Plus the idea of dropping in and out of
reality without notice or by accident.
- Mr. Moore story.
	- The fish and chips place
- I should request the project info from Mr. Francis now, so I have some guidelines.
- Scenes from HP.
	- I don't know why.
- The funny thing is that I’m enjoying myself writing this. Does that make sense?
Because I don't know if this “idea” will be enjoyable for someone else to read. __SO:__
#### What is my purpose for writing this?
- I want to get an assignment for English done on time for once.
- Of course, to improve my grade in English class.
- Maybe it will help me work through the events of my life and self reflect?
- Is this selfish?
- Is self reflection selfish?
- Maybe I could represent people I know in the story, what if as characters. What people
have been a challenge in my life?
	- My relationship with my Dad.
- In stories I've read, the big problem is often not introduced in the beginning of the story.
Hence “rising action”

More theme ideas:
 - I’m almost a junior, and my sister is an adult now. It will be soon for me. What
	will I do?
 - Plus going on a mission and college.
 - This is sounding like quite a long kind of story, so quick thought, I might kinda plan a
longer version, but split it into chunks and finish just one chunk for this project, for
English.


#### Symbolism:
 - Sin / Mistakes
 - Temptation
 - People, society
 - Arina as my conceince
