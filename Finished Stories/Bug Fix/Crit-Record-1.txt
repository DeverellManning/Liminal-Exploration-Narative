@Draft Ping
This is my first time writing something for LA.  Right, this is a tale for the backrooms system.  Also looking for feedback on the title.  I came up with several more title ideas that I'll put in here.  1200 words?  I'm not sure about C4C.  It sounds like a good idea, maybe only if it's roughly the same length.  I've never done critique before.

btw if a different team crits this they can steal a point from yellow

We are lit by a dim, blue light. Where are we? I’m confused. Despite this, we aren't hurt.

we is used 3 times in this stretch. May want to find alternatives to the word, to avoid repetition. (edited)
[9:55 PM]
@Deverell Manning compliment already, this dialog flows nicely and is very naturalistic and not forced. Good work!
[9:56 PM]
Arina says, “It seems like not much happens around here. It’s almost calming”
period here, easy fix.

Egg2 — 05/04/2024 9:58 PM

backrooms is a wide wide spanning concept

Deverell Manning — 05/04/2024 9:59 PM
I might make a level page later

Egg2 — 05/04/2024 9:59 PM
I don’t see where or how this fits into the Backrooms
[9:59 PM]
Which means
[9:59 PM]
No crit point…

Tomu — 05/04/2024 9:59 PM
thats for the concept crit later.

Egg2 — 05/04/2024 9:59 PM
It’s the perfect ploy

We’re being played like FOOLS right now…

Tomu — 05/04/2024 10:00 PM
“Maybe. It’s almost too calming. Every time we cross a passage or find one of those rooms, I have this distinct feeling that we were not supposed to be here. How big is this place?”

“What if ... this place wasn’t made for people?”

“When is someone going to notice us? Doesn’t this place have any security?”

As we approach an intersection with another hallway, I hear a quiet whirring noise. A short, three-wheeled cart, moving autonomously, appears and suddenly stops. A piece detaches, turns, and faces us. It turns in place and heads back the way it came.

“What?”

“Do you think it saw us?”

“Why didn’t it stay?”

“Should we follow it?”

“I think we should follow it. Maybe there are others? Maybe they’ll show us out.”


OK: The dialog here gets a little muddy with it's run on without any sort of indicator to see who's who. You did well earlier with the back and forth someone shrugs etc
try a bit more of that here too, as its confusing

Egg2 — 05/04/2024 10:00 PM
[10:01 PM]
Pretty decent writing though, nice dialogue

Tomu — 05/04/2024 10:01 PM
the dialog is a big highlight yes! (edited)

im going piece by piece crit here, ill let ya know when its all wrapped up

Oh
[10:02 PM]
It's another ping inside a thread
[10:02 PM]
Crazy how this is written in Github 

Tomu — 05/04/2024 10:03 PM
It turns a corner and disappears out of sight. Right as I step up to the corner, Arina grabs my arm.

I think a substitute can be found for corner being used twice here. Perhaps find a different word to replace one of the corners with, preferably the second use of corner.
[10:04 PM]
I pause. Indeed, I can hear, and feel a low rumbling.

Replace rumbling with rumble here? may add a little bit of extra flow.
[10:04 PM]
“I don’t think we're supposed to be here”

add a period, also reminder about the dialog notifyer thingy crit from earlier, adding those to this article (not in excess) will make this read much more clearer (edited)
[10:07 PM]
It is holding in front of it a needle.

Reads a bit weird, maybe try something like "A needle protrudes from its chassis, pointed directly towards us."

Tomu — 05/04/2024 10:11 PM
“If there is, I don’t want to meet it.”
It’s getting quite dark now. Barely visible, the floor feels somewhat uneven. We carefully navigate down the corridor. After a while, I see something up ahead.“Hey! I think I see some light.”



this bunch is a lil weird, space the dialog out from the desc like you did with the other dialog parts. Minor rec too, you may want to rewrite the desc to be something more like  "Little to no visibility lies ahead, and the floor..."

otherwise good!
[10:11 PM]
A cool breeze barely ruffles my fur.

Fur???
[10:12 PM]
The cool wind blows past us from above. Above us are more catwalks, smooth walls, holes, and the walls of the tube receding into darkness.

Dual above usage back to back. Could be cleaned up with another word, preferably in the first instance of above.
[10:16 PM]
I hear warping, twisting metal right behind me. I glance over my shoulder.

"Arina! The bridge is breaking!"

Metal is twisting under my feet. Ahead of me, she leaps and barely reaches the edge. She catches on and climbs the rest of the way up.

We repeat the twisting action twice, and i think it can be cut down on and reworded (edited)

Tomu — 05/04/2024 10:27 PM
The bridge drops out from beneath me. She reaches out and grabs my hand. I swing forward, hitting the wall under her feet. The impact yanks us apart and I fall, barely missing the chute. Falling into the depths of the Machine. Why is it trying to kill us?

 
Pretty abrupt ending! What does it all mean...
Transitioning into conceptual crit. 


How is this related to liminal archives and it's themes? I can gather they are in some sort of supercomputer limspace, but it's not liminal at all at least through the description, just very techy. The robot stuff also makes it very unliminal and sci-fi-y.

What is the meaning/significance of the article outside of personal means? There isn't an overlying story being told, and it feels like an excerpt from a sci fi novel about a pair infiltrating a megacorps computer. It's well written, but I don't see like any overarching attempt at a storyline here. Just like 3 events that happen back to back.

The ending leaves a lot to be desired, ending abruptly with the characters supposed dead and no explanation of basically anything we had just read. What's up with that? Feels unfinished, or without detail and that seriously detracts from the overall story. Pacing is a little weird too, and the scale feels way bigger than the pacing gives it credit for.

Are the main characters furries? It seems implied. How does that fit into LA at all??

What does this have to do with the backrooms? This carries none of it's themes, no preestablished lore or connections, implies a canon-breaking entrance, and just isn't related. I would say it would work as an individual limspace not linked to the backrooms, but concept crit point 1 comes up.

Overall, this doesn't really seem to fit on the site, despite it's quality writing. I would say either completely rework it from a story standpoint and location and lore standpoint, or take this story and flesh it out more offsite to be it's own thing.

@Deverell Manning crit, finished.

Thanks for the crit.  I will review the descriptions and dialogue, some of it wasn't actually finished, so I will fix that.

This story evidently has a long way to go as far as being a Backrooms tale.  Later when I'm online again I will try to detail my thoughts and ideas about the world this is happening in.  In short, I have a limited word count for this project so I had to reduce the events of the story.  Hence, the overall story that this is part of does not start here or end here.  More later.
[11:22 AM]
Once again, I am working through all of the crit, it all sounds valid.  Thanks so much for reviewing my story!
