# The Machine's Problem

Breathing hard, my eyes adjust to the dimly lit hall.  My friend and I are surrounded by countless blinking lights.

“Now where are we?” I say.  I’m as confused as she is.  “Is this place safe?”

She shrugs. “I don’t feel safe.”
	
I smell the air.  Metallic, ozone, hints of burning acid.  “These kinda look like server racks.  Maybe we're in a massive supercomputer.”
	
We quietly wander past more machines.  They are reminiscent of an old mainframe, or a television control room.  Quietly humming, musically beeping and buzzing about their work.  We are lit by a dim, blue light.  Where are we?  I’m confused.  Despite this, we aren't hurt.  I’m with my friend.  It isn’t that bad.

<br>

We step through a door into a room lined with quietly humming computers.  Packed between two beeping cases is a desk with a keyboard and monitor.  I move aside an office chair to take a closer look.  It displays a lock screen and password prompt.  Dead end.  No clues, nothing to figure out.
	
Arina shrugs. “That’s odd.  Normally they don’t put terminals inside the supercomputer.”
	
“Yeah.  I think you're normally not supposed to have people inside the computer unless it’s for maintenance or something.”
	
“We’ve broken that rule already.  I wonder what kind of security this place has.”
	
“I haven't seen any cameras,” I say.  “Even if we get caught, who’s gonna believe that we were trying to escape that thing, tripped, and fell into the middle of this giant supercomputer?”
	
She laughs.  “Deverell, I think we have worse problems if we get caught,” she says.  “How did these ... foxes ... get into my supercomputer?!  Out! Out!”

We wander down another hallway, our footsteps quiet on the concrete floor.  According to my watch, it’s been almost two hours.  It all blends together, nothing different about the majority of the machines.  Many of them appear identical.  Hundreds of LEDs blink in unison.

Arina says, “It seems like not much happens around here.  It’s almost calming”

“Maybe.  It’s almost too calming.  Every time we cross a passage or find one of those rooms, I have this distinct feeling that we were not supposed to be here.  How big is this place?”
	
“What if ... this place wasn’t made for people?”

“When is someone going to notice us?  Doesn’t this place have any security?”

As we approach an intersection with another hallway, I hear a quiet whirring noise.  A short, three-wheeled cart, moving autonomously, appears and suddenly stops.  A piece detaches, turns, and faces us.  It turns in place and heads back the way it came.

“What?”

“Do you think it saw us?”

“Why didn’t it stay?”

“Should we follow it?”

“I think we should follow it.  Maybe there are others? Maybe they’ll show us out.”

<br>

We follow it at a distance.  It doesn’t turn around.  Oddly, it won’t go faster than walking speed.  It seems like it knows where it’s going though.  It turns a corner and disappears out of sight.  Right as I step up to the corner, Arina grabs my arm.  “Don’t you hear that? That rumbling?”

I pause.  Indeed, I can hear, and feel a low rumbling.

“I don’t think we're supposed to be here”

“But how do we leave?”

<br>

A large metallic object rolls around the corner at a walking pace.

It is holding in front of it a needle.

Several more come out behind it, advancing on us at the same slow pace.

“I guess we’ve been discovered.”

“Great. Let’s get out of here!”

I run down the opposite passage.  We are faster, but there are many robots.  I rush through countless dim corridors.  All the same, all exactly alike, except now something’s different.  The front panel of a machine is partially ripped out, with sharp metal edges, and exposed circuitry.  None of the lights on the machine are lit.  Near it, there is a similar broken machine.  Further along, none of the machines are powered.

I glance at Arina.  “What did this?”

“I doubt it was those robots.  Is there something else here?”

“If there is, I don’t want to meet it.”
It’s getting quite dark now.  Barely visible, the floor feels somewhat uneven.  We carefully navigate down the corridor.  After a while, I see something up ahead.“Hey! I think I see some light.”

---

We’re close to the opening.  A cool breeze barely ruffles my fur.  I step through, into a broad tube.  We’re standing on a bluish metal grate that extends around the edge of the tube in an arc.  The cool wind blows past us from above.  Above us are more catwalks, smooth walls, holes, and the walls of the tube receding into darkness.  Below me, I can — Oof. Vertigo hits me.  I stumble away from the edge.

She whispers. “Are you okay?”  It echoes from across the chute.

I’m clutching the wall.  “Yeah.  I’m fine.”

She peers over the edge.  “This cylinder extends farther down.  There’s some kind of orange glow down there too.”

I do my best not to look down.  We are traversing the catwalk toward the opposite side where there is an exit.  I’m glad that there’s a railing, otherwise I would have just turned back around.  I try to look straight ahead.  The endless abyss under my feet makes my stomach churn.

Just as we get there, I hear the harsh sound of tearing metal. Turning around, I see one of those smaller robots drive away on the other side of the catwalk.

It looks like a section of the catwalk was cut off and pulled to the other side.

“Great! Now there’s no way back!”

“Why do you want to go back?”

“I’m more worried about what's ahead.”

---

We’re both looking for a way out now.  Doors are locked.  The next intersection is blockaded.  We’re being forced down a straight, narrow corridor ending with a door.  We don’t have any other choice.

I open it.  Burning air blows past me.  It stings my nose and mouth.  Inside there is a single catwalk that crosses over a trough of molten orange metal.  That pungent, metallic odor gets even closer.

Arina scowls.  "Let's turn around.  This is way too risky."

I agree.  "Yeah. I'm not going in there."  I turn around, and a big bulky robot rolls into the doorway, blocking it.  So we walk into the room.  I inch down the railingless platform.  Just a catwalk separates us from a burning death.

Halfway across the bridge.  She’s right in front of me.  We’re almost at the other end, but that doesn’t mean we’re safe.  Where are we being sent?  Suddenly, the bridge shakes.  I hear warping, twisting metal right behind me.  I glance over my shoulder.

"Arina!  The bridge is breaking!"

Metal is twisting under my feet.  Ahead of me, she leaps and barely reaches the edge.  She catches on and climbs the rest of the way up.

The bridge drops out from beneath me.  She reaches out and grabs my hand.  I swing forward, hitting the wall under her feet.  The impact yanks us apart and I fall, barely missing the chute.  Falling into the depths of the Machine.  Why is it trying to kill us?
