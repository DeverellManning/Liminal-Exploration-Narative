- A rainforest above the clouds, or on floating islands
- Steal  the ageless woods
- Based on 'Bliss' Photo
- A secluded fishing pond at the bottom of a pit.
- Storming shores, like SIlent beach kinda
- Burnt Forest
- A farmlands level, like Parmesan or or Almond fields.
  - Expansive fields, indefinite in size.
  - Broken by hills, canals, small woods
  - The saeasons pass, offset in different places. Short winters
  - No people, just those who wander
  - The crops are harvested with out hands.
  - Source of food found in other backrooms levels?
